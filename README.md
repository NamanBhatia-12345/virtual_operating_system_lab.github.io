It is basically web-based application. In the Operating System lab aims to implement & analyses the basic CPU scheduling algorithms which can be used to solve various computational problems.
1.	First Come First Serve
2.	Short Job First
3.	Round Robin
4.	Priority scheduling
In this lab we implement First Come First Serve and Short Job First CPU scheduling policies. In FCFS, the process that request CPU first is allocated the CPU first. In SJF algorithm associated with each process of length of process next CPU burst time .Round Robin is a CPU Scheduling Algorithm where each process is assigned a fixed time slot in a cyclic way. The priority of a process is generally the inverse of the CPU burst time, i.e. the larger the burst time the lower is the priority of that process.
